**Prompt for creating a decision flow for your code:
//
Generate a textual flow diagram for the following code:

[Your Code Here]

Please follow the format below for the diagram:

[Start] -> [Initial Operation]
    |
    v
[Decision/Action] -> [Consequence/Next Action]
    |
    v
[... Repeat for subsequent actions and decisions ...]

Finish with:
    |
    v
[End of program]

Provide clear indications of where each piece of code corresponds to the flow steps, including any relevant conditional logic or loops. 

Thank you!

Create a textual flow diagram based on the following C code:

[Code block to be analyzed]

Please use the format below for the diagram:

[Start] -> [Description of Initial Operation]
    |-> Code Snippet: [Related code here]
    |
    v
[Decision/Action] -> [Consequence/Next Action]
    |-> Code Snippet: [Related code here]
    |
    v
[... Repeat for subsequent actions and decisions ...]
    |-> Code Snippet: [Related code here]
    |
    v
[End of program]

Include all loops and decision-making processes with corresponding arrows and descriptions, and provide clear indications of where each piece of code corresponds to the flow steps, including any relevant conditional logic or loops.
