//SPOON FEEDER PROMPT TO MAKE AI ASK FOR CODE:
"Ask me for code one file at a time as needed to make the changes.
I'll say 'y' after each step if successful or share the issue. Just give me code to paste and tell me where exactly to paste."

Usage: When you have already established the context by sharing file structure with the AI and you need the AI to ask for code to make changes.

//SPOON FEEDER PROMPT:
"Now, please give me one simple, concise, actionable step at a time to solve this. 
I'll say 'y' after each step is done. Just give me code to paste and tell me exactly where to paste."

Usage: When the AI is giving you a bunch of steps and complex advice.

The basic idea is to send an api call to open ai with user query, it returns the correct end point to use with Go Maestro.
Go Maestro receives the call and gives blockchain data.
The blockchain data along with the original query is sent to openai api again to receive the answer to the query and sent it to the user.
